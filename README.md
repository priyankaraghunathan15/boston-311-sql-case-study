# Boston 311 Service Requests: SQL Analytics Case Study

This project analyzes 311 service request data from the City of Boston using advanced SQL to extract operational and service performance insights. Through structured queries and analytical techniques, it examines how city departments handle resident complaints, evaluates resolution efficiency, and identifies which submission channels are most frequently used. The goal is to uncover trends in service delivery, assess departmental workload and compliance with service-level agreements (SLAs), and inform opportunities for operational improvement.
